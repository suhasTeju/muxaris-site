# Architecture

## Call pipeline

1. **Gateway** (`apps/voice-gateway`) runs the live call: speech in, speech out, tools.
2. **Recorder** mixes both sides into a stereo WAV, caller on the left channel and assistant on
   the right, 16 kHz. It is skipped when the clinic has `settings.recordCalls = false` (the
   transcript is still saved) or when storage is disabled.
3. **S3** receives the files when the call ends:
   `clinics/{clinicId}/calls/{callId}/recording.wav` and
   `clinics/{clinicId}/calls/{callId}/transcript.json`. Objects are encrypted (SSE-S3) and a
   lifecycle rule deletes them after 90 days. The call row tracks `recordingStatus`.
4. **SQS** gets a `call.completed` message from the gateway.
5. **Post-call worker** (`workers/post-call`) reads the turns and asks Amazon Nova Pro on Bedrock
   (`apac.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`) for a summary, sentiment and entities. It writes
   `calls.summary`, `calls.sentiment` and `calls.analysis`, and may create a callback. Duplicate
   deliveries are no-ops. A stale-call sweep runs every minute and closes calls left in progress.
6. **Dashboard** (`/app/calls`) lists calls, plays the recording through a short-lived presigned
   URL and shows the transcript in sync with the audio.

Per-clinic setting: `settings.recordCalls` (default on), changed by owners in Settings. The
opening note on every call says it may be recorded and transcribed.
